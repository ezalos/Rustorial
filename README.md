##Chapter 1
It explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!” program, and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool.

## Chapter 2
It is a hands-on introduction to the Rust language. Here we cover concepts at a high level, and later chapters will provide additional detail.

##  Chapter 3
It covers Rust features similar to those of other programming languages, and head straight to

## Chapter 4
Is to learn about Rust’s ownership system.

## Chapter 5
It discusses structs and methods

## Chapter 6
It covers enums, match expressions, and the if let control flow construct. You’ll use structs and enums to make custom types in Rust.

## Chapter 7
It’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy rules for organizing your code and its public Application Programming Interface (API).

## Chapter 8
It discusses some common collection data structures that the standard library provides, such as vectors, strings, and hash maps.

## Chapter 9
It explores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.

## Chapter 10
It digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the power to define code that applies to multiple types.

## Chapter 11
It is all about testing, which even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure your program’s logic is correct.

## Chapter 12
We’ll build our own implementation of a subset of functionality from the grep command line tool that searches for text within files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts we discussed in the previous chapters.

## Chapter 13
It explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come from functional programming languages.

## Chapter 14
We’ll examine Cargo in more depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others.

## Chapter 15
It discusses smart pointers that the standard library provides and the traits that enable their functionality.

## Chapter 16
We’ll walk through different models of concurrent programming and talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple threads fearlessly.

## Chapter 17
looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming principles you might be familiar with.

## Chapter 18
It is a reference on patterns and pattern matching, which are powerful ways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs.

## Chapter 19
It contains a smorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe Rust, macros, and more about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures.

## Chapter 20
We’ll complete a project in which we’ll implement a low-level multithreaded web server!
